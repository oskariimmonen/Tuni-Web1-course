  <h1>3.6 HTML Template Tag</h1>

  <h2>Exercise Overview</h2>

  <p>
    In this exercise you will again manipulate the DOM tree. You will use JavaScript to take user
    input from a form and create and add new content inside a div element on the same page. This time
    you will have to use a <em>template</em> tag which defines the structure of the new content. Again
    the HTML is already given inside the <em>index.html</em> file. Your JavaScript code should be saved
    to <em>template.js</em> file inside the same directory.
  </p>

  <h2>Implementing the Exercise</h2>

  <p>
    Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its
    <em>exercises/03_html/3.6-html-template-tag</em> directory where this <em>instructions.html</em>
    file is located. Then:
  </p>

  <p>
    In this exercise you will input contact information of people in a form and then append that
    information to the end of the contacts listing.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Write your code into <em>template.js</em> file inside this directory.</li>
    <li>
      You can find the HTML in the <em>index.html</em> file inside this directory.
      Make note of the IDs and classes of the elements in the HTML. You can use them in
      your code to get hold of the elements. <strong>DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Contacts will be added inside the div element with id <em>contacts</em></li>
    <li>
      Each individual contact will have the HTML structure of the template tag with id
      <em>contact-template</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Attach an event listener to the <em>form</em> element's <code>submit</code> event. The event listener
      is responsible for taking the input from values from the form and <em>appending</em> them inside the
      div with id <code>contacts</code>. The event listener should perform the following operations:
      <ol>
        <li>
          First cancel the default action of submitting the form. See:
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_preventdefault.asp">
            preventDefault() Event Method</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the contents of the template tag and clone them to a new DOM node. See:
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template">
            &lt;template&gt;: The Content Template element</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Replace the contents of the cloned template contents with the contact information from the form.
          <ul>
            <li>Replace the h2 heading with the name of the contact.</li>
            <li>
              Replace the text inside the paragraph element with class <em>email</em> with the email
              address of the contact.
            </li>
            <li>
              The last paragraph with class <em>homepage</em> has an anchor (a) tag inside it.
              Replace the anchor's target address (href attribute) and the text inside the tag with
              the homepage address of the contact.
            </li>
          </ul>
          All of the above updates should be done on the cloned node.
          <strong>Do not change the original template element or its contents!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Append <strong>the cloned node</strong> to the end of the div with id <em>contacts</em></li>
        <li>
          Reset the form to its initial state. See:
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_form_reset.asp">Form reset() Method</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Remember to commit <em>template.js</em> and push the changes to your Git repository
      before you submit your work in Plussa.</strong>
