  <h1>3.3 Method Based Routing</h1>

  <h2>Exercise Overview</h2>

  <p>
    In this exercise you create a Node server which will respond to any http GET request with one
    HTML file and to any POST request with another HTML file.
  </p>

  <p>The server must have the following functionality:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Server listens on localhost port 3000</li>
    <li>
      On every http GET request the server responds with the contents of <em>get.html</em>
      file in this directory.
    </li>
    <li>
      On every http POST request the server responds with the contents of <em>post.html</em>
      file in this directory.
    </li>
    <li>
      On every other type of request the server responds with a status code <code>405</code> (Method Not Allowed).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Implementing the Exercise</h2>

  <p>
    Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its
    <em>exercises/03_html/3.3-method-based-routing</em> directory where this <em>instructions.html</em>
    file is located. Then:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      In this directory run the command <code>npm init</code> to initialize your Node project.
      Use the default values proposed by <em>npm</em> by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li>Write your server code into <em>index.js</em> file in this directory.</li>
    <li>
      In exercise <em>2.6 Routing</em> your server responded differently based on the URL.
      This time you will choose your response based on the http method of the request:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any GET request should be responded with the contents of the <em>get.html</em>
          file in this directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any POST request should be responded with the contents of the <em>post.html</em>
          file in this directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any other request should be responded with a status code <code>405</code> and the response
          should also have a header: <code>Allow: GET, POST</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Every GET and POST response should also have <code>Content-Type: text/html</code> and status code
      <code>200</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Remember to commit and push all changes to your Git repository before you submit
      your work in Plussa.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>About Testing</h2>

  <p>
    Once your server is up and running you can test it with the <em>index.html</em> that you created in
    the previous exercise <em>3.2 HTML Forms</em>. Open the file in your browser and submit the first
    form to test the response to the GET method and submit the second form to test POST response. Of course
    Postman or curl or some other similar software can also be used to test the server.
