  <h1>3.4 DOM Tree</h1>

  <h2>Exercise Overview</h2>

  <p>
    In this exercise you are going to use JavaScript to work with the DOM tree of an HTML document.
    This includes creating and deleting elements and manipulating element attributes. The <em>index.html</em>
    file includes the starting HTML of this exercise and your job is to write the accompanying JavaScript
    and save it to <em>dom-tree.js</em> file inside the same directory.
  </p>

  <h2>Implementing the Exercise</h2>

  <p>
    Start by making sure you are in your local clone of the Git repository, and in its
    <em>exercises/03_html/3.4-dom-tree</em> directory where this <em>instructions.html</em>
    file is located. Then:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Write your code into <em>dom-tree.js</em> file in this directory.</li>
    <li>
      You can find the HTML in the <em>index.html</em> file inside this directory.
      Make note of the IDs and classes of the elements in the HTML. You should use them in
      your code to get hold of the elements. <strong>DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      Your code should perform the following DOM manipulations:
      <ol>
        <li>Add a class <code>list</code> to the navigation link list (unordered list, ul) inside nav element.</li>
        <li>
          Create a new link (anchor tag, a) as <strong>the last item</strong> inside the navigation link list.
          The link must have <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> as its target address (href attribute)
          and the text <em>Localhost</em> inside. <strong>Remember to put the anchor tag inside a list
            item (li) tag.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Insert a new list item (li tag) with the text <em>Item 0</em> as <strong>the first element</strong>
          of the ordered list (ol) with the id <em>ordered</em>. Note that the text has the number zero as its
          last character.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the class <code>navi</code> from the todo list (unordered list, ul, with the id em{todo}).
          <strong>Do not remove any other classes from the list!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete the second list item from the todo list. The the text inside the item is <em>Item 2</em>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The order of the DOM manipulations inside your code does not matter. Only the final resulting
      DOM tree is important.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Remember to commit <em>dom-tree.js</em> and push the changes to your Git repository
      before you submit your work in Plussa.</strong>
