/**
 * Here we have grade() function that will be mocha tested.
 * The test reside in file test/mocha.test.js.
 * Some of the tests pass gracefully, a few of them fail. 
 * 
 * Examine the tests, and fix grade() function accordingly,
 * so that all the tests will pass.
 *
 * The grading is done piece-by-piece, points are incremented if test is OK
 * The first test checks that maxPoint is an even number
 * The second test check that the answer is string
 * The rest checks the right format of the string
 * 
 * TODO: there is currently something wrong with the function
 * 
 * @param answer the string to be tested
 * @param maxPoints the maximum points that can be reached.
 * 
 * @return received points that can range 0..maxPoints
