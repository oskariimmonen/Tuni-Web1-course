    <p>Responsiveness implies the ability of Web content to adapt to a
      new circumstances, such as the browser window being resized, or being viewed
      with on different sized displays.
      In a previous exercise we implemented the CSS for the UI shop.
      This exercise extends the layout by making it responsive, but now with media queries.
    </p>
    <p>Make online shop adapt to different device sizes using CSS media queries. The sizes needed for this exercise are listed here:</p>

<table style="font-size: 80%;">
            <tbody><tr>
              <td>Small phone</td>
              <td>&lt; 600px</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Phone</td>
              <td>600px - 767px</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Tablet</td>
              <td>768px - 991px</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Desktop</td>
              <td>992px - 1199px</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Wide desktop</td>
              <td>&gt;= 1200px</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody></table>
      
<p>Grids can be used as an assisting tool.</p>

    <p>The procedure is the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy index.html and styles.css from <code>ex4</code> to <code>ex6</code></li>
      <li>Add responsiveness to <kpd>styles.css</kpd> with media queries, like in the previous exercise with fluid
        grids. The layouts for the different screen sizes are as follows (the elements IDs remain the same as in previous exercises): 
        <ul>
          <li>if size is <em>small phone</em>,
            <em>section</em>, <em>aside</em>, and <em>nav</em>
            elements reside in one column; the order is s1, a1, s2, a2, s3, n1, n2</li>
          <li>if the size is <em>phone</em> or <em>tablet</em>, elements are set in two columns, 
            the order remains the same, however, <em>nav</em> elements must go to a separate row</li>
          <li>if size &gt;<em>tablet</em>, elements are set in three columns. Now, the order changes a bit: 
          first row consists of s1, s2, and a1, next row of s3 and a2; the last row of n1 and n2. Three columns in each row.</li>
          <li>if there is need for empty elements, these are put in the middle.</li>
          <li>Save your style definitions in styles.css.</li>
        </ul>    
      </li>
      <li>Commit your changes to git repo</li>
      <li>Submit your work to Plussa</li>
    </ul>
