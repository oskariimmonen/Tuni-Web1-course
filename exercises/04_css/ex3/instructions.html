    <title>HTML with semantic tags</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
        In this exercises you are going to build a general on-line shop UI with HTML. The UI employs semantic markup, i.e., the new tags introduced in HTML5. Semantic elements define the role of the content to screen readers and search engine more specifically
        than traditional non-semantic elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        This exercise is done in anticipation of practising CSS in the next execise. For the purpose, we need an HTML file with suitable tags with ids and classes in place. In this exercise, we will implement the HTML part, and then the next exercise concentrates
        on putting all the bits and pieces in place.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shop uses such semantic tags as <em>main</em>, <em>header</em> and <em>footer</em> with <em>navs</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Inside <em>main</em>, there is an <em>article</em> with <em>sections</em> and <em>aside</em> elements, see Fig.1. that shows the version after HTML file from this exercise will be styled with CSS in the next exercise.

    <h2>The UI of the online shop</h2>
    <p>
        You implement the UI for a online shop using <em>HTML only</em>. Implement the exercise in the
        <em>index.html</em> in the same directory as this <em>instructions.html</em> file. It should be valid HTML5. CSS and CSS rules are not a part of this exercise, but CSS rules are implemented in later exercise in this round.
    </p>
    <p>
        When creating the UI you will need to use <em>semantic tags</em>, for more information about semantic tags see
        <a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/">https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/</a> .
    </p>
    <h3>Semantic tags - a brief overview</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>header</strong> – The &lt;header&gt; element defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>nav</strong> – Main navigation menu links would all be placed in a &lt;nav&gt; tag. But sub navigation menus elsewhere on the page could also get one.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>main</strong> – The body of a page should go in the &lt;main&gt; tag – not sidebars and main navigation. There should be only one per page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>article</strong> – The &lt;article&gt; element defines self-contained content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. For example, a blog post.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>section</strong> – Using &lt;section&gt; is a way of grouping together nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs to an article tag because it isn’t necessarily self-contained.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>aside</strong> – An &lt;aside&gt; element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars – areas that hold complementary, not vital information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>footer</strong> – You would use &lt;footer&gt; at the base of a page or section. It might include contact information and some site navigation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        See <em>Fig.2.</em> for visualization of the layout that can be achieved with these elements. Only the semantic elements themselves are important here, not the example content shown in these elements.
    </p>

    <p>Fig.2. Online shop UI with right elements and example contents</p>

    <ul>
        <li><em>header</em> is the first container element, it contains a nested <em>nav</em> element.</li>
        <li>Next, comes a <em>main</em> element, in contains an <em>article</em> element inside it. Inside the <em>article</em> element, there are three <em>section</em> elements and two <em>aside</em> elements.</li>
        <li><em>footer</em> is the bottommost element under <em>main</em>. <em>footer</em> contains two <em>nav</em> elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The container-containee relationships in your <em>index.html</em> file should be as described above. If there are more than one containee, using IDs is necessary. IDs are unique, and they make it easier to point to a specific element e.g. when positioning
        them. IDs should be as described in the table:
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Parent element</td>
            <td>Element requiring ID</td>
            <td>IDs of the elements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>article</td>
            <td>section</td>
            <td>sec1, sec2, and sec3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>article</td>
            <td>aside</td>
            <td>aside1, aside2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>footer</td>
            <td>nav</td>
            <td>nav1, nav2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


    <p>Notice: the actual positioning of the elements is achieved with CSS grids, which is implemented in the next exercise.
