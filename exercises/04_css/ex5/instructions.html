    <title>Responsive web with grids</title>

    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Responsiveness implies the ability to adapt to a new circumstances, such as the view resized or being viewed with different size displays. In the exercise previous exercise, we implemented the CSS for the shop UI. This exercise extends the style
            declarations by making them responsive to the available screen size.
        </p>
        <p>In this exercise you make the online shop page adapt to different device screen sizes using CSS grids. NOTE: media-queries must not be used. The columns in the grid must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be at least 400px wide</li>
            <li>if there is excess space, maximize the space usage, and occupy it all</li>
            <li>in case whent there is not enough space available, be shown in one-column mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Responsiveness must be handled with the following elements, which are to be placed side-by-side if space allows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>section</em></li>
            <li><em>aside</em>, and</li>
            <li><em>nav</em></li>
        </ul>
        where <em><code>sections</code></em> and <em><code>aside</code></em> are inside <code>main</code>, <br> and <em><code>navs</code></em> in the <code>footer</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Note: the solution does not have to be based on <em>grid-area-templates</em>.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>The procedure is the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Review <em>index.html</em> and <em>styles.css</em> files in this directory</li>
        <li>Add responsiveness to
            <kpd>styles.css</kpd> with grids, the appropriate places are marked with TODOs Check Plussa instructions.</li>
        <li>Commit your changes to git repo</li>
        <li>Submit your work to Plussa</li>
    </ul>
